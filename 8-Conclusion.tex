\section{Conclusion}

The PAMELA framework promotes a modeling paradigm where models and code are jointly developed to provide a continuum between model and source code. The support is supplied by Java annotations and the PAMELA interpreter at runtime.

The different experiments provide efficient examples to argue the benefits of
the PAMELA framework but it is better to make your own experiences through {\url{https://pamela.openflexo.org/}.
